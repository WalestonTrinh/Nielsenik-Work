üñãÔ∏è Introduction

This repository contains my solution for the Nielsenik Technical Test

The project is divided into two main tasks:

Enriching the dataset by adding app titles and editor names.
Analyzing the impact of Covid confinement on in-app purchases.

# Dataset Enrichment Approach

To answer the first question, I implemented a Jupyter notebook (Final.ipynb) that processes the dataset as follows:

Image Hashing: Each image URL was hashed using a perceptual hashing algorithm to generate unique identifiers.

Matching Process: The hashes were compared against those from the external data source to find the closest matches.

Table Join: Once the app title and editor names were retrieved, a simple XLOOKUP function was applied using the URLs to join the enriched data with the main table.

This approach ensures a reliable and automated way to map the correct app information despite inconsistencies in image URLs.
